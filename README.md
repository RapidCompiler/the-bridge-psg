Redesigned the Recruitment page of The Bridge PSG

This is a simple Flask application that runs on a small Heroku server, showcasing the Recruitment page of The Bridge PSG. 
I used a free bootstrap CSS & HTML template called Lumia and completely customized it to the website's requirements. All notable features on this website are listed below.
* Used the same Favicon from the official website. (Used a favicon grabber tool)
* Colour matched the exact shade of yellow from The Bridge's logo (Used a colour matching tool)
* Provided links for the socials of The Bridge
* Added a mail button in the **Apply!** section of the website, which opens the local mailbox
* Provided links to the official website of The Bridge
* Added a **Subscribe** button which allows to subscribe to The Bridge Newsletter
